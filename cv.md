About myself
---
He graduated from courses in front-end direction in the summer of 2020. Up to this point, I was engaged in writing landings and individual tasks in free form. At the moment, I continue to delve deeper into the study of this direction (react).
I am fond of active recreation: camping, sports games (basketball, volleyball).
Sociable, stress-resistant, I have experience in personnel management (setting and clarifying tasks, performing according to deadlines). I also have experience in the purchase and sale of goods.
